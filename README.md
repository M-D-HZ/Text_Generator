Writing a book is hard, but in this day and age we have computers to help us with correcting text and avoiding common grammar mistakes. Now, why won't we let a computer write the book for us.

Of course this is with a little guidance and computers are not always perfect. Hence we allow the user to add some words and let the computer auto-complete this. On top of that, we know that any artist sometimes get their reference from other books and texts, so we got something for that too on out plan.

## 🕵️ How?

It might all seem intimidating but it is quite simple to understand how this works! Informally, the program reads the text we give it and learns patterns of sentences. With a little bit of ✨magic✨ the computer shall create a 🔗[Markov Chain](https://brilliant.org/wiki/markov-chains/)🔗, pun intended, in order to better calculate what words best fit.

It is possible that we will use external libraries for this program, we will definetly write down our sources and respect the builders of these libraries.
